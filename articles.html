<!--
There should be a way to list date/time posting using this method.
Will need to parse json output into some readable variables,
then appened output to the bottom or top of article.
Downside is that this will pretty much mean we will have to rely on
gist for articles if we want the site to flow properly.

            <summary>The state of the world</summary>
            <p>Lately, with the state of the world,
              this project seems to have more significance.
              There are a lot of things that can be said,
              and to leave them inside the mind is frankly a disservice
              to the world. No one knows if the world will care to even
              see these thoughts or ideas – as most of them won’t be original.
              However, communication is worthless with out comprehension.
              An original idea can be conveyed in many ways, but only understood by
               a few. There are a of new ideas in this age, but not a lot of comprehension.
